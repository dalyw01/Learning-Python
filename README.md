# Learning Python

[TheNewBoston](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJbPGzawDH1njbqV-D5HqKw) does some amazing tutorials. I've learned from his Java and Ruby videos in the past.

His [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBxCHonP6Ro&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_) tutorials are exellent.

The resulting files in this repository are from me going through the 56 tutorials!
